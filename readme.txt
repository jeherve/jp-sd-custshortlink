Use shortlinks instead of permalinks in Jetpack sharing buttons

== Description ==

Use shortlinks instead of permalinks in Jetpack sharing buttons

* If you haven't set up any shortlink plugin on your site, the sharing buttons will use the default numerical permalinks
* If you have enabled WP.me Shortlinks in Jetpack, the sharing buttons will use them
* If you've installed another plugin to create custom shortlinks, the sharing buttons will use them

Important: for this plugin to work, you must activate [Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/) first, and activate the Sharing module.

== Installation ==

1. Install the Jetpack plugin, connect the plugin to WordPress.com
2. In Settings > Sharing, enable sharing buttons
3. Install the Jetpack shortlinks for sharing buttons plugin via the WordPress.org plugin repository, or via your dashboard
4. Activate the plugin
5. Enjoy :)
